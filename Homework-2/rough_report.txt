[10pts] The dataset type(s) (it could be just one type, or multiple types if itâ€™s heterogeneous)
    - Integer and String types

[10pts] Number of items and fields/attributes
    -838 items and 5 fields/attributes

[10pts] The types of all the attributes
    -State Code: Integer
    -State Abv: String
    -Damage Code: Integer
    -Damage Descp: String
    -Amount: Integer

[10pts] A concise description for each attribute based on what you think the attribute means in this context
    -The state code is a numerical representation of the state
    -The state abv is a 1:1 identifier for the state code
    -The damage code is a numerical representation of the damages
    -The damage description gives context to what each type of envirmental damage is, with a 1:1 relationship with damage code
    -The amount is the magnitude of damage measured in US Dollars

[10pts] For each attribute determine its cardinality/range
For categorical attributes, write down the number of unique levels
For quantitative attributes, specify the range from min to max and note any other characterization that seems potentially useful (cyclic? Anything else?)
For ordered attributes, consider whether it would be more useful to treat them categorical or quantitative, or to preserve them as ordered.

[10pts] Write two questions you would like to answer with this data set. 
    - What is the most damaging type of damage?
[20pts] For each question, write the following information:
Do you need a chart in order to answer this question?
If none of your questions require a chart, try to create a new ones that might benefit from one.
Which fields/attributes do you need to use to answer the question?
Do you need to transform the data in order to answer the question? If yes, what transformations are needed?
Do dataset type and attribute type change when you need to transform the data? If yes, how do they change?
Do you have all the data you need to answer this question, or would you need additional data fields that are not provided here?


############### Excess Moisture/Precip/Rain appears to have the highest damages
